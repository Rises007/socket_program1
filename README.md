# DNS-Based Chat Programming Using Socket Programming

This project implements a DNS-Based Chat Program using socket programming, enabling real-time communication between users. The program allows users to send and receive messages through a server. It showcases the use of socket programming techniques to achieve efficient message exchange and seamless user interactions.

## Features

- Real-Time Communication: The chat program enables users to send and receive messages in real time through a server.
- DNS-Based Communication: Users can send messages to other clients using their unique IDs registered in the DNS database.
- Efficient Message Exchange: The program utilizes socket programming for efficient and reliable message transmission.
- Technology Stack: The project is implemented using C++ and socket programming.

## Getting Started

To run the DNS-Based Chat Program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Rises007/DNS_Based_Chat_Program.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd DNS_Based_Chat_Program`

### Server

3. Compile and run the server: g++ server3.cpp -o server3 -pthread
## Client
4. Compile and run the client: g++ client3.cpp -o client3 -pthread
